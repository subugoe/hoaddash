    "text": "Data and methods\nTo engage with everyone, our open source dashboards combine open data from multiple sources as follows:\n\nJournals included in transformative agreements were obtained from the cOAlition S Transformative Agreements Public Data (July 2021, July 2022, May 2023, and December 2023 snapshots). Agreements with German consortia were derived from Germany’s Open Access Monitor (March 2022). We enriched both journal data sources with ISSN-L, a linking identifier for ISSN variants. Then, we excluded fully open access journals from the cOAlition S Transformative Agreements Public Data by cross-checking with several datasets of fully open access journals: the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), Bielefeld GOLD OA and OpenAlex.\nCrossref is our main data source for determining the publication volume in hybrid journals including the uptake of Open Access through Creative Commons licenses. The ESAC guidelines, a community recommendation for negotiating transformative agreements, require publishers to make key metadata elements publicly available through Crossref, such as Creative Commons licensing information for Open Access articles. As a Crossref Metadata Plus subscriber, we used monthly Crossref snapshots to derive publication data.\nOpenAlex is our data source for determining the country affiliation of lead authors. A lead author is the first named author of a scholarly article who has usually carried out most of the research presented in the article, although author roles can vary across disciplines. We used OpenAlex monthly snaphots as a data source to determine lead author affiliations.\nTo highlight potential gaps between Crossref open licensing metadata and information provided via journal webpages, we used OpenAlex as a complementary data source for Open Access articles in hybrid journals.\n\nThis compiled data is openly available through an R package, hoaddata. hoaddata contains not only datasets about hybrid open access. It also includes code (mostly SQL) used to compile the data by connecting to our cloud-based Google Big Query data warehouse, where we store big scholarly data from Crossref, OpenAlex and Unpaywall. hoaddata is automatically built and updated per month using GitHub Actions, a continuous integration service.",

The resulting website is published on GitHub pages.\nAs statistical tools, we used a bunch of tidyverse packages. Visualisations were made interactive through ggiraph and plotly.

Limitations include:\n\nJournal-level data associated with publishers and transformative agreements are highly dynamic and are subject of change.\nAlthough we were able to exclude most full open access journals from our data, there are a few subscription-only journals in our dataset that do not offer open access publishing options.\nCrossref metadata does not distinguish between article types. We used an extended version of the Unpwaywall paratext recognition approach to exclude non-scientific content from our data. However, the annual publication volume of some journals may be inflated by proceedings supplements.\nOpenAlex, from which we obtained our affiliation data, is a relatively new scholarly data source. There is ongoing activity to improve the parsing, normalisation, and disambiguation of institutions (see here). We used pattern matching to increase the recall of country affiliations.\n\nTo better understand the strengths and limitations of our data work, we commissioned a study from the Deutsche Zentrum für Hochschul- und Wissenschaftsforschung. The aim is to compare our open data with information contained in the proprietary bibliometrics database Scopus in relation to hybrid open access. Key findings will be made available.",
